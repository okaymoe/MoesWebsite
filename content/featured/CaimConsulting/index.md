A principal clone of okcupid. With PokéCupid, users are able to create an account and connect to other users for multitudes of purposes, some including finding a significant other, 'training partners', or simply friends! Created with 3 other lovely team members, Niels Griedel, Connor Burns, & Matilda Zhang.
