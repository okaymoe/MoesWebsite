Hi! I'm Mohamad! I was born and raised in the New Jersey outskirts of New York City. I've made quite the career-switch, coming from the entertainment industry into tech, but no stranger to tech for certain.

Pioneering through the early stages of Social Media, in just three years, I've amounted to over 500,000 followers spread-out amongst Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, etc. 

My interest in the tech industry stems from my early childhood. Knowing how to navigate a computer and the internet at age four, I was practically raised by technology. It fascinates me how much technological advancements we've made in the last two decades alone, and I want to be an engineer that stresses the capabilities technology still has in store!

I'm currently in search of my first Junior Developer role.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
